# Relational Algebra: True or False 

## Point 2 (a): Every relational algebra expression without negation is monotone

### Statement:
"Every relational algebra expression that does not use negation is monotone, i.e., if tuples are added to the input, the output can never become smaller."

### Answer:
**True**

### Explanation:
Monotonicity means that adding more tuples to the input relations cannot reduce the output. In relational algebra:
- **Set operations** like projection (`π`), selection (`σ`), Cartesian product (`×`), join (`./`), and union (`∪`) are monotone.
- These operations either preserve or expand the dataset.
- Negation (e.g., difference `−`) or anti-joins are required to reduce output when new tuples are added.

#### Example:
Let `R = {(1), (2)}` and `S = {(2), (3)}`.  
For the projection `π`: If we project `R` on its first column, adding `(3)` to `R` results in a superset of the output.  
Without negation, this monotonic behavior holds for all cases.

## Point 2 (b): The operators ∩ and ∪ are redundant

### Statement:
"The operators `∩` (intersection) and `∪` (union) are redundant, i.e., every relational expression can be rewritten into an equivalent one without `∩` and `∪`."

### Answer:
**False**

### Explanation:
While some cases of `∩` and `∪` can be rewritten using **joins** and **set differences**, these operators provide concise and efficient constructs that are not fully redundant.

#### Counterexample for `∩` (intersection):
To rewrite `R ∩ S` without `∩`, you would need to use a join and additional constraints:
```sql
SELECT R.*
FROM R JOIN S ON R.key = S.key;
```
This becomes cumbersome, especially for larger datasets or complex conditions.

#### Counterexample for `∪` (union):
To rewrite `R ∪ S`, you would need:
```sql
SELECT * FROM R
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM S
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM R
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM S;
```
This is far less efficient and harder to interpret.

These examples demonstrate that `∩` and `∪` are practically indispensable in relational algebra.
